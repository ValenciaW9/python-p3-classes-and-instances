class Dog:
    # SOME CODE TO DESCRIBE A DOG

    # new code goes here

    #TheDog class is defined with the class keyword, followed by the class name and closed with a deindentation to the level where we defined the Dog class. The body of this class is the code block between our first identation and out final deindentation

    # Class names begin with capital letters because they are stored in Python constants. if your class name contains two words, the names should be in the UpperCamelCalse(also called PascalCase if your'e feeling fancy, like this: class MyClass
    # some codeall about  your awesome class 
    # new code goes here
    # Eith this code alone, we can now make new dogs!
